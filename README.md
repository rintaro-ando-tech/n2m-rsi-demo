Collaboration & Commercial Licensing
I am actively seeking industry partners and university collaborators interested in recursive self-improvement theory, LLM safety, or applied projects.
If youâ€™d like to discuss a joint project, internship, or sponsored position, please reach out!

Commercial use (integration into proprietary products or for-profit services) requires a separate license agreement.
